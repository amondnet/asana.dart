# **createAttachmentForTask**
> InlineResponse200 createAttachmentForTask(taskGid, optPretty, optFields, limit, offset, file)

Upload an attachment

Upload an attachment.  This method uploads an attachment to a task and returns the compact record for the created attachment object. It is not possible to attach files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box & Google Drive via the API. You must download the file content first and then upload it as any other attachment.  The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.  This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.  Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\\r\\n` outlined [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:asana/api.dart';
// TODO Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
//defaultApiClient.getAuthentication<OAuth>('oauth2').accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN';
// TODO Configure HTTP basic authorization: personalAccessToken
//defaultApiClient.getAuthentication<HttpBasicAuth>('personalAccessToken').username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
//defaultApiClient.getAuthentication<HttpBasicAuth>('personalAccessToken').password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD';

var api_instance = new AttachmentsApi();
var taskGid = 321654; // String | The task to operate on.
var optPretty = true; // bool | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
var optFields = [["followers","assignee"]]; // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
var limit = 50; // int | Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
var offset = eyJ0eXAiOJiKV1iQLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9; // String | Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'
var file = BINARY_DATA_HERE; // Uint8List | 

try { 
    var result = api_instance.createAttachmentForTask(taskGid, optPretty, optFields, limit, offset, file);
    print(result);
} catch (e) {
    print("Exception when calling AttachmentsApi->createAttachmentForTask: $e\n");
}
```
